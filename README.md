Analyze-NYSE-Data:

How Do You Complete this Project? This project is connected with the Introduction to the Data part of the course, 
but depending on your background knowledge, you may not need to take this module to complete this project.

Introduction For the final project, you will conduct three tasks:
1) complete your own data analysis and create a presentation to share your findings,
2)   develop a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement, and
3) create a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios.
4)  You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming which sub-category and company you want to focus your data analysis on - the questions leading to this page should have assisted in
    this process! Then you should use spreadsheets or another Excel-like software to conduct your analysis and choose a sub-category and company you are most interested in.
This project is open-ended in that there is no one right answer.
